# INF564

Lab assignments from the Compilation course at Ecole polytechnique. Statements are provided in the README files.

- **TD 1**: x86-64 assembly

The goal of this assignment is to introduce the x86 assembly language (the target language for our compiler). In this assignment we must complile 3 C programs into x86 assembly: a simple printf call, a program to compute integer square roots, and a solution to [Project Euler's Matrix Sum problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=345).

- **TD 2**: Mini-Python interpreter

The goal of this lab is to build an interpreter for a simple fragment of Python, called [mini-Python](https://www.enseignement.polytechnique.fr/informatique/INF564/projet/mini-python-v1.pdf). The exercise includes different types of statements (assignment, conditional, loop (for), output with print, returning a value with return, evaluation an expression) and expressions (processing constants, access to a variable, building a list, access to a list element, function call, binary operators).

- **TD3**: Lexical and Syntaxical Analysis (Mini-Turtle parser in Java)
The goal of this lab is to implement the parsing of a small Logo language (graphical turtle) whose interpreter is provided. Parsing is implemented using the tools JFlex and CUP.
