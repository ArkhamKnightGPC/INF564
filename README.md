Lab assignments from the Compilation course at Ecole polytechnique.

- **TD 1**: x86-64 assembly

The goal of this assignment is to introduce the x86 assembly language (the target language for our compiler). In this assignment we must complile 3 C programs into x86 assembly: a simple printf call, a program to compute integer square roots, and a solution to [Project Euler's Matrix Sum problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=345).
